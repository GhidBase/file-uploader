# EXPRESS TEMPLATE

## How to use

-   **Install**

    -   In the command line run "npm install" to install the dependencies

-   **Setup Environment**

    -   Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
    -   Add `PORT=3000` (or any port you prefer).
    -   To use the log-in functionality you'll need to
        the session functionality too. Sessions require
        a database to be connected.
    -   To use the database functionality, add this to
        the .env:  
        `DATABASE_URL='your full database URL'` and
        `SESSION_SECRET='a random string'`.
    -   The SESSION_SECRET will be used to encrypt
        passwords. Any people trying to access your
        database and login will need to have the exact
        same SESSION_SECRET as the one used originally


-   **Run the server**

    -   In the command line, run `node app` to start the server.
    -   By default, the homepage will show: **"Template project loaded"**.
    -   You will also see a message in the browser console:  
        **"this is a public file"** (demonstrating serving a public file used by an EJS template).

## Features Included

-   **MVC structure**

    Organized into controllers, routes, views, and database modules.

-   **dotenv**

    Used to set your `PORT` and `DATABASE_URL` environment variables.

-   **Express**

    -   Configured to use EJS as the view engine
    -   Serves `/public` as the static assets directory

-   **pg (PostgreSQL)**

    Using `Pool` from the `pg` library to query the database defined in `DATABASE_URL`.

-   **Authentication - Passport**

    Passport is used for authentication on this template. All the configuration is already done, when connecting a database all the necessary tables will automatically initialize. Sessions are stored on the database using connect-pg-simple, so logged in sessions will be remembered even if the node server is stopped. bcryptjs is used to encrypt all the passwords in the database so if the users table is ever leaked, no passwords will get out.
